### **Removing a Label from a Node in Kubernetes**

To remove a label from a node in Kubernetes, you can use the following command:

```bash
kubectl label node <node-name> <label-key>-
```

#### Breakdown of the Command:

- `<node-name>`: The name of the node from which you want to remove the label.
- `<label-key>`: The key of the label you want to remove. The `-` at the end of the label key indicates that the label should be removed.

#### Example:

If you have a node named `worker-node-1` with a label `env=production` and you want to remove the `env` label, you would run:

```bash
kubectl label node worker-node-1 env-
```

This command will remove the `env` label from the `worker-node-1` node. You can verify that the label has been removed by describing the node:

```bash
kubectl describe node worker-node-1
```

This command will show the current labels on the node, confirming that the specified label has been removed.

### **Monitoring Pods with `kubectl`**

It looks like you tried to use `kubectl watch pod`, but `watch` is not a valid command in `kubectl`. If you want to continuously monitor the status of pods, you can use the following alternatives:

#### 1. Use `kubectl get` with `--watch`:
```bash
kubectl get pods --watch
```
This command will display the status of all pods in the current namespace and update the output in real-time.

#### 2. Use `kubectl get` with a specific pod name:
If you want to watch a specific pod:
```bash
kubectl get pod <pod-name> --watch
```
Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the specific pod you're interested in.

#### 3. Use `kubectl describe` with `--watch` (for more detailed info):
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name> --watch
```
This will give you detailed information about a specific pod and update in real-time.
